A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/chrisgannon/pen/rrpLkK.

 This is an exploration of an alarm UI that displays both analogue and digital clocks.

This is designed to be mobile first - it's also a rough prototype so I haven't cleaned any of the code and, to be honest, I'm a bit stuck with the direction of it so any suggestions are welcome!
